# minishell
Create a program that behaves as shell

## Description

The minishell can run binaries, send some signals, manage pipes, redirections ```"<", ">", ">>"``` and heredoc, create variables and use them and manage environt variables.

This project was paired so i had a teammate to finish it. My part is about run binaries, pipes, redirections, some builtins and manage variables.

It has following builtins: echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, exit. They also behaves like do it ones from originall shell.

## Compilling

Makefile will create the binary named minishel. All you need to do is to rut it.
